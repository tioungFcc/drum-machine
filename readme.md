That was a challenging project i.e. when you start to forget stuff or mix up everything and then, you will be using addEventListener instead of onClick and so on.
Spent a lot of time on inline styling using variables, props and googling about volume sliders and react hooks.
Main weakness: React hooks i.e useEffect and useRef. Got the project working but useEffect and useRef are still very challenging to me.

# modified onkeypress

## enclosed in React.useEffect with 2 arguments, volume an powerStatus
